# EROS-Counterfactual
Code and data to reproduce counterfactual model analyses in Dedman et al. *Ecological roles and importance of sharks in the Anthropocene Ocean*

Main data file is available as part of MacNeil et al. 2020 "Global status and conservation potential of reef sharks" here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjwld9lrfl1a7pk/FinPrint_Set_Data.csv?dl=0

FinPrint_Set_Data.csv and Location_Covariates.csv are from MacNeil et al. 2020 and are used in EROS_counterfactual_models.ipynb to produce final distributions that are used in EROS_gravity_maxn_plots.R to plot Figure 1D: Counterfactual predictions of relative abundance of reef sharks in the presence (status quo) and absence of humans.

FinPrint_reefs_gravity.csv and totgravity_data.csv are used in EROS_gravity_maxN_plots.R to produce Figure 1C: Reef shark relative abundance and number of global coral reefs along a gradient of human pressure (total gravity). FinPrint_reefs_gravity.csv contains the gravity and average MaxN values associated with all 371 reefs sampled as part of FinPrint data associated with MacNeil et al. 2020. totgravity_data.csv contains total gravity decimal values for a global distribution of coral reefs created by Dr. Eva Maire, Lancaster University.
